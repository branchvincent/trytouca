# Project Structure

Touca is a large project with many components, from various SDKs in different
programming languages, to the Touca Server with all its moving parts, to our
marketing and documentation websites, utility packages, command-line tool, etc.
All of these components live in our open-source monorepo
[trytouca/trytouca](https://github.com/trytouca/trytouca) on GitHub. We'd like
to show you where you could find these components and briefly explain how they
relate to each other.
